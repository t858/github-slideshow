														The call to action is a key ingredient to any effective marketing program. Columnist Jeremy Smith explains how CTAs work and what every one of them must have to be successful.


	 If you have a website, you have a call to action, or CTA — multiple CTAs, probably. There’s no such thing as a successful marketing campaign unless there is a successful CTA.

	 Conversions, revenue, business and profit — they all depend on the mighty call to action. The CTA is so powerful, so important and so foundational to the success of any online marketing initiative that I just have to tell you how to develop CTAs that will benefit your business.

	 I know this from working as a consultant to dozens of businesses and coaching hundreds of marketers. This information is too important to sit on.


	 So below, I’m going to describe what a CTA is and the many forms it can take, and how to make sure your CTAs contain the basic elements that must exist to make them work well for you.



	 No, seriously…

	 <b>Who’s Calling Who To What Action?</b>
	 The call to action, better known as the “CTA,” is an appeal to users, inviting their response. In digital marketing, the CTA is usually a button with copy.

	 Conversion is simply getting someone to respond to some kind of a call to action. A successful CTA results in a conversion. Most of the time, it involves a click or tap on a button.

	 There are literally thousands of different types of calls to action. You can use a call to action whenever you want the user to do something or respond in some way.

	 A CTA can be used to spur users to take any step: download a PDF, fill out a form, buy a product, or even just click through to another page.

	 Michael Aagaard of Unbounce calls the CTA the “tipping point between bounce and conversion.”

	 Here are some of the most common types of CTAs:

	 1.Buy buttons/“Add to cart”
	 Information-gathering forms
	 Subscription signups
	 “Read More”
	 “Try it Now”
	 Social media share buttons/widgets
	 Help — now a friendlier “Online Chat” in many cases
	 Here’s how and where you’re likely to encounter CTAs:

	 2.Persistent headers — like Hello Bar
	 Pop-ups and slide-ins
	 Side panels
	 Purchase pages
	 End of page, article, post
	 In ads
	 The fact is, CTAs can go just about anywhere. And they should. Posting CTAs all over your website is a great way to attract more conversions.

	 <b>What’s In Your CTA?</b>
	 A CTA is meant to entice a website visitor to take a specific action that benefits you. You must pour every creative, compelling and persuasive effort into making your CTA as good as it can possibly be.

	 There are three main features to a CTA:

	 Where it is (Placement).
	 What it looks like (Design).
	 What it says (Copy or Text).
	 Tim Ash, CEO of SiteTuners, writes this about the CTA:

	 For your CTAs to work, two things need to happen. First, visitors need to be able to spot them without any effort. Second, visitors must instantly know what they do.
	 His advice dovetails with my outline. In order to easily spot the CTA, it has to be 1) placed correctly and 2) designed accurately. And in order to know what to do, 3) the text on the CTA must be very clear and compelling.

	 Let’s take a deeper dive.

	 <b>Placement</b>
	 There are three basics to CTA placement:

	 Have multiple CTAs. There is a mistaken notion that there should only be a single CTA on a page. The more CTAs on a page, the more chances the user has to convert at any point on the page. Use CTAs liberally, and your conversions will go up.

	 But CTAs on a page must not compete with each other. Don’t confuse the user with too many options. Choice paralysis can too easily set in, causing the user to make no choice at all.

	 Put CTAs on every page. Every page gives users a new opportunity to do something — to convert in some way. So why not add a CTA? Not just “Why not?” — do it. Give users the opportunity to convert.

	 Make CTAs prominent. Place your CTAs strategically, so that they receive maximum attention and visual focus. Multiple eye-tracking studies have shown that website users scan pages in an F shape.

	 Starting in the upper-left corner, a user typically makes two glances across the page horizontally, then looks (and/or scrolls) vertically down the left. This suggests you should place CTAs in headers, side-panels and at the end of the page, article, post and so on.

	 But as always, you should test to find out what works for visitors to your site.

	 Here’s a great example of side-panel placement. One glance across the page — Join us! Second glance across the page — Register Today. Bang. Boom.

	 side-panel placement
	 <b>Design</b>
	 As the marketing and conversion expert, you must use your best judgment and research to guide creation of the CTA. Your designer will do the hands-on work and will likely have good ideas, but you need to make sure the final product does what it’s meant to do and doesn’t just sit there and look good.

	 Make sure your CTAs are designed to be:

	 <b>Recognizable.</b> As ConversionXL says, people spend most of their time on other websites and are accustomed to common wording, like “prices” or “log in.” Don’t let your message get lost in a fog of creativity. People must recognize your CTA as something they are meant to click on.


	 <b>Well-Defined.</b> A CTA should be part of the page but set off from the main body of text. Use a stark outline or shadow and/or contrasting colors to provide a clear definition to your CTA.

	 You can also use negative space to define your CTA. Negative space is an empty area around the CTA (or any design element). Sitepoint defines “negative space” as “the breathing room around the subject,” which helps define it and adds to its appeal.


	 <b>Striking.</b> Your CTA must stand out; it should call out to the user. To do this, for starters, it should introduce a strong, contrasting color to the page.

	 Below, the orange pops out of the white background. It contrasts not only with the white of the background, but also with the website’s blue color scheme.





	 <b>Appealing.</b> Here’s where a good designer will earn her keep. Your CTA’s look should draw people to it. Colors, image and typeface create appeal when used correctly together.

	 One of the most well-known design tips is that the most compelling design element you can use is the image of a person looking back at the viewer. Why do you think the concept of “cover girls” was created?

	 This pop-up CTA strategically uses bold colors, the image of a person (the author) and a sans-serif typeface to provide aesthetic appeal and adds a streamlined call to action:


	 <b>Copy</b>
	 Photos and video are a plus, but websites still rely on words to get the job done when it comes to conversions. It comes back to the old adage, “You have to ask for the sale.” Unbounce’s Aagaard insists that the copy is the most important feature of a CTA:

	 But in that last critical moment, when the prospect has to make up her mind, the copy itself is what she’s going to interact with.

	 a single word change on a CTA button
	 To compel a website visitor to act, the text in your CTA must:

	 1.<b>Be clear.</b> Your CTA must have an obvious thrust. The user wants — needs — to know what will happen if he or she clicks your CTA button. Your CTA must match what the user anticipates.

	 For example, if a visitor to your site is reading about a free e-book you’re offering, then the CTA should make it obvious that he or she will get the free e-book if they click on the button. If you are selling pineapples, the CTA needs to let users know that if they click through, they can buy your pineapples.

	 This is no time for surprises, secrets or subtlety.

	 Some CTA buttons, actually say “next” on them. This is just about worthless. You need to tell people what comes next, not push them toward some murky abyss where they’re about to convert with no clue about the “next” they’re getting themselves into.


	 Whatever action it is meant to compel, your CTA text needs to say what you mean and mean what you say. Be clear and direct, and make sure the button performs as advertised.

	 In fact, ConversionXL says when they clicked the Seminole Sitters’ “Pay Now” button, they couldn’t actually pay. That CTA’s grade falls from an A to an F with one click of a mouse.

	 2.<b>Use active verbs.</b> Your CTA should be as strong and motion-oriented as possible. It’s a call to ACTION, after all.

	 The “Holt Handbook Sixth Edition” tells us that when a verb in a sentence is active, the subject of the sentence (the understood “you” in your CTA, i.e., the website visitor) acts or does something. When a verb is passive, its subject receives the action or is acted upon.

	 Use an action word: Order, Subscribe, Buy, Get, Learn, Discover … “Get” works pretty well, actually. Everyone likes to get something, and we all know what “get” means. It’s short, too.


	 3.<b>Communicate value.</b> You’re asking users to act, so you need to make them understand that they’ll get something worthwhile in return. Obviously, this is true if the action is to hand over some money. But any action online is an investment of time and effort, so the ROI must be apparent.

	 Ask yourself: “What’s in it for the customer? Why should they click here?” Answer those questions in your CTA.

	 Unbounce’s Aagaard uses these three contrasting examples to depict adding value to a CTA:



	 4.<b>Provide assurance.</b> Building trust is a big part of e-commerce and conversions. Trust signals are important in landing pages and in CTAs.

	 You can instill trust with only a few words. A conventional subscribe button adds a layer of trust simply by telling users that they can “unsubscribe at any time.”


	 <b>Conclusion</b>
	 All of your website’s power comes to a fine point in the CTA. The user’s action is what it’s all about. Once you understand the basics of what a CTA is, its function, goal and proper content and usage, then you can create CTAs that improve conversion.

	 A CTA that works consistently is a creation of art and beauty. Its effectiveness is up to your imagination and your skill.

	 Start creating CTAs, keep testing your CTAs and allow your conversions to rise.

                            In order to optimize  your website to show up or rank on a Search Engine you have to know exactly what the top Search Engine is.<br><br>  Right now in 2019 that Search Engine is google. So, this means we need to optimize our website for Google’s  Search Engine.How do we do that? Well, I’m glad you asked! The next Paragraph is going to break down “keywords” which is one of the biggest tools that You will use when focusing on your websites SEO.


						</p>
						<h2 style="padding-bottom: 20%;padding-top: 20%;">SEO Keywords</h2>
						 <p></p>



						<img src="images\keywords-letters-2041816_1920.jpg" height="20%" width="60%" style="padding-top: 10%;padding-bottom: 10%;">
							 <p>


                            Keywords are pretty much how they sound. Keywords are words you use in your content

                            (These are things like a blog, a video, an image or even an infographic.) So let’s go over a way you can use keywords to help your seo.						<br><br>
							I want to really break this down so basically anyone can find this blog article, read it and know a good amount of information about SEO, keywords and everything I’m writing about in this blog post. 						<br><br>
							So, first of all when you are trying to use a keyword to help boost your seo you need to make sure you’re using a keyword that is regularly being searched. Since, I run a web design and marketing company in San Antonio , Texas, I need to make sure that I try to use keywords that entail this.						<br><br>
							So, basically I would use words like Web Design or words like marketing, I would even use words like San Antonio, Texas. The reason I want to include these keywords, is again so that the top used search engine will show my site as popular by using these keywords on my site so that when google crawls my website it can really understand what my website is about.						<br><br>
							By the way, web crawling is another way of saying searching for things. Basically google crawls the web to find certain words ,items or pieces of information. It returns that data and then uses that data to adjust what it show’s first and last.

                            Using the right keywords allows google to understand what your site is about.						<br><br>
							So,when I use words like “ San Antonio’s Web Design” on my website it tells google that my site is about just that! Your site might be about something else. Your website might be about computer repair or barber shops or what have you. So let’s say you have a website about hair and you are a barber.						<br><br>
							You would want to make sure your website includes words like hair, barber, scissors, barbershop, etc.


						</p>
						<h2 style="padding-bottom: 20%;padding-top: 20%;">Long Tail Keywords</h2>
						 <p></p>



						<img src="images\structure-620304_1920.jpg" height="20%" width="60%" style="padding-top: 10%;padding-bottom: 10%;">
							 <p>


                            Long tail keywords are basically keywords that are enclosed in phrases or keyphrases.

                            An example of a long tail keyword, for a barbershop would be something like “ Great barber shops in the san antonio area.” or “How do barbers make swag lines” For a Web Designers website you could use something like “ The best website designer in San Antonio Texas” or something like “What is Seo?” or even “What are Long Tail keywords?”. 						<br><br>
							In other words, you want to use “key” “Phrases” that are relative to your topic.  A Youtube channel that is all about “How to become a Professional Barber” would not use long tail keywords like “ what color is my dog” or “ My web Designer is in San Antonio” He would use something more like “Top ten places to buy barber scissors” or “ How do I find a good barber college” or how much do Professional barbers make”. It is USUALLY, easier to rank on google with long tail keywords.						<br><br>
							However, if your competitor knows what they are doing than they will most likely try to rank for long tail keywords as well as regular or short tail keywords.

							 <p>




                            So, now you know you need keywords on your website to help your SEO. Great, but how do you find them? 						<br><br>
							Well, There are a few ways you can do this.  First you can use google’s keyword planner. You can watch the video below to learn more about that. But basically, you just go to <a href="https://ads.google.com/intl/en_us/home/tools/keyword-planner/">Google's keyword plannner</a>						<br><br>
							and google will help you find the right keywords to use to boost your seo by utilizing it’s resources to recommend words you can use that your target audience in  your niche are already using. You just put in a word or two and google recommends several related words that are searched most often on google.						<br><br>
							keyword planner will even tell you who is ranking number one currently for certain keywords.

                            will help with your citations/ online real estate.


                            For instance, let’s say you wanted to optimize your coffee website to show up on Google’s first page for words like coffee, or cappuccino. 						<br><br>
							You can look at google’s keyword planner and see that the top website ranking for that word is starbucks and pretty much all the related words. So if you were to start a small niche website about coffee it might fail horribly unless you really put into the work. You would have to work really hard to rank high for the word “coffee”.						<br><br>
							You can try, but that’s why it is so important to do your keyword research and to use long tail keywords. Even though starbucks might be the top ranking site for the keyword coffee, you can still optimize your seo for long tail keywords like “how much coffee is too much”.



                            The second way to find keywords. This is something I found recently works really well for me as I have a pretty extensive history as a writer.						<br><br>
							Before I became a developer I was very much interested in being a professional writer. Anyway, another thing you can do is look at your local competitors websites. Read their blog section. If they have a blog article about  SEO but it is only say “666 words and 3,873 characters” Than chances are you could probably write an article that would crush their blog article. 						<br><br>
							By the way you can check your competitors word count by using a site like “https://wordcounter.net/” Which is what I usually use when I am thinking about crushing a competitor in SEO.







                            A third way kind of requires you to have already had some keywords on your website.



                            You can pretty much Check which keywords on your website is ranking the best by using google search control.						<br><br>



                            You would of course click performance and than queries.

                           Under queries you will see your keywords

							<br><br>



                            Hopefully, you have many clicks and impressions prior to starting your new keyword campaign.







                            Anyways, once you load the tool you can see which keywords were searched and how well your website ranked for each keyword. <br><br>At the time this article was written We were ranked best for "web design" and "San Antonio" and worst for "content strategy" for web development in san antonio. However, I’m sure with a few minor adjustments we could easily rank for the “content strategy" for web development in san Antonio if we just focused a few highly targeted keyword articles for that long tail keyword. <br><br>We would simply have to write an article that would grab our users attention whilst using the long tail keyword several times.<br><br> However, we would also need to make sure the article is relevant  to a “content strategy for web development in san antonio” We could also go the route of writing several elaborate articles for that specific long tail keywords and rank that way as long as each article contains useful information that engaged the user for a significant amount of time.<br><br>You see google will rank a website higher if users click on a link or go to a page and stay on that page for long periods of time. This is because google interprets this as engagement and a high engagement rate tells google that a website is doing well and is providing quality content.

                            Your websites HTML or (Hyper Text Markup Lanuage) Has a lot to do with your SEO.



                            For example, The way you write an article will affect the way google and other Search Engines will Crawl your website. <br><br> If you don’t use The proper heading tag in the correct spot than google’s Search Engine will not properly read your site. This can be problematic when trying to rank for certain things. Luckily google’s algorithms have gotten better to prevent this. However, it is always wise to be safe than sorry.




							<br><br>



                            Your websites P tags can also affect your Seo in the same way. Google needs to know what content is being used where. If you type if your content as “

                            ” instead of “
                            ” Google will notice and won’t crawl your website properly.<br><br> Which will cause you to lose traffic and thus lose revenue.









                            Another thing that will affect your Seo which still falls under html is your meta tags. There are several meta tags that will affect your seo ranking. <br><br>Such as your title tag, which goes in your header section of your websites code. Your description tag will also affect your seo as well. Both of these tags are what google show’s when your website is shown on google’s website.





							<br><br>



                            Now, Other than the meta tags for your description and for your title you also need to make sure you have the google site verification tag. You can also find this with-in google search console.<br><br> You have to upload a file that they give you to your website so that google can verify your website.







                            Additionally, you can use the geolocation tag however, google has publicly stated they are not longer using this as a ranking factor as of june 2016. <br><br> However, if you are using google maps pack to help your google maps ranking it could still be beneficial if you need to be found in a certain location.

                            You need to make sure your site loads quickly and look good on all devices. This means you need to make your site responsive. Your videos need to load on all devices from desktops to mobile phones to tablets. <br><br>You can’t just have a website that loads slowly on a desktop and expect your desktop users to just stay on your website when they can just go to the next similar website that loads quickly.<br><br> The same goes for phones and tablets. Most people are in a hurry and don’t have time to wait for a slow website to load when they can just get the same information faster somewhere else. <br><br>Google simply won’t allow a website to rank high on the serps if the website is not user friendly. Google’s ranking factors  now – nowadays are all  about user experience.

						<h2 style="padding-bottom: 20%;padding-top: 20%;">Social Media</h2>

							 <p>


                            You want to be on social media sites like pinterest twitter, instagram, Facebook, tumblr etc.





                            You also want links coming to your website from your social media and to your social media from your website.<br><br> This works by creating real estate across the internet. You’re creating citations across the web which google sees are references.<br><br> That being said you need to keep in mind  that there are do follow links and no follow links the only two social media sites right now that allow do follow links are twitter and tumblr. <br><br>Which means links from those websites will help you rank higher in google. The non follow social media sites.
